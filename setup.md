## Setup Python

Make sure that you have the latest Python installed. The latest Python released is `Python 3.11.3`

- To check the installation open a terminal and run:

```bash
python –version
```
- or if you have Python3:

```bash
python3 –version
```

- If you have an outdated version of Python, I strongly recommend to update it. To update it run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10
```

- Again, check the version:

```bash
python –version
```

```bash
python3 –version
```

## Setup Pytest

- Open the terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -U pytest
```
- or if you have pip 3:

```bash
pip3 install -U pytest
```

- To check the installation open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ pytest --version
pytest 7.3.1
```
